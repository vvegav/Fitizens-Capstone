# YOLO HUMAN DETECTION AND REPNET

In this section we implemented a Human Detector model by using YOLOv8s, and we used REPNET to count the repetitions

[Human Detection YOLO](https://github.com/gor2000/CAPSTONE-FITIZENS/blob/main/YOLO%2BREPNET/YOLO_Human_Detection.ipynb)

* It contains a jupyter notebook with all the steps followed during the training and fine-tuning.
* In addition to that notebook we have a full report of all metrics and log loss during each epoch. You will find it in this link [wandb](https://wandb.ai/aieteam/human%20detection?workspace=user-)


[Repnet](https://github.com/gor2000/CAPSTONE-FITIZENS/blob/main/YOLO%2BREPNET/repnet_colab.ipynb)

* Contains the jupyter notebook where we count the repetitions for exercises
