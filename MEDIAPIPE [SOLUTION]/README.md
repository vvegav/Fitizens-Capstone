# Mediapipe Demo

In this section we developed the first solution by using Mediapipe.

There are 3 folders:

[Demo with Streamlit](https://github.com/gor2000/CAPSTONE-FITIZENS/tree/main/MEDIAPIPE%20%5BSOLUTION%5D/demo_streamlit)

* It contains an app.py file with the Streamlit application.
* In this application we implemented optimization techniques and it's our more optimized demo. 
* To run Streamlit you will need to insert this command in the console from the root directory:
1. `cd mediapipe/demo_streamlit`
2. `streamlit run .\mediapipe\demo_streamlit\app.py --server.maxUploadSize 500`


[Demo with Gradio](https://github.com/gor2000/CAPSTONE-FITIZENS/tree/main/MEDIAPIPE%20%5BSOLUTION%5D/demo_gradio)

* It contains an app.py file which is the demo that uses Gradio. 
* To run Gradio you will need to insert this command in the console from the root directory:
1. `cd mediapipe/demo_gradio`
2. `python .app.py`

[Mediapipe Notebook](https://github.com/gor2000/CAPSTONE-FITIZENS/tree/main/MEDIAPIPE%20%5BSOLUTION%5D/jupyter_algorithm)
* This contains all the testing and final algorithm using jupyter notebooks
